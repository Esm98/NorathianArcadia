Starting from screen shot 221 and moving forward you can see the game in the initial state to when the player has died.
The player is the green square
The enemies are the red square.
If the player attacks a small sword or red square comes out of the player square whatever direction the player is facing.
If an enemy is there the enemy dies.
When an enemy dies he leaves a blue square on the map that will be gold, exp, or a piece of equipment. 
This will be an rpg galaga type game but with more drops and possibly magic attacks depending on how much time it is taking.
I have a sprite sheet I will use for graphics and item pick ups. The sprite sheet is from https://gamefromscratch.com/universal-sprite-sheet-character-creator/
As the game progresses the enemies will change. The background will be at first a forest, then a dungeon type which will all be just a 2d image. 
I have experience with unreal but it is time consuming and I can lose 12 hours in a day messing with an animation so I wanted to avoid that. 
The goal is for the player to just grind armor upgrades and kill the bosses in quicker and quicker time.
I hope to add  functionality and attacks to the bosses where the player can learn the pattern but I'm hoping to use some AI techniques learned in the class to make the AI also learn.
